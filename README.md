# Course-Planner-Project

#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I was solving with this project was to find a way to sort courses so students could easily see what courses they need and what prerequisites are required for future courses. 

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by first creating pseudocode to get a rough idea of how I want the program to work. Then I had to consider which data structure was the best for what the client was looking for. In this case, I felt a hash table was the most efficient way to go. Data structures are important to understand because they all serve a different purpose and not one type can solve every problem. Based on what they program needs to do, some structures are better than others. There are things that need to be taken into account (such as if updates will be made consistently, efficiency, memory management, and amount of information being inputted) that can help developers make the right choice of which structure would best fit the requirements. So understanding the advantages and disadvantages to each structure is important. 

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Honestly, I really struggled with this project. I couldn't figure out how to create a hash table without turning the input into a CSV file. Then, from there came the actual problem where the program wasn't reading that file correctly. It kept printing commas and wouldn't load the data correctly. I went through tutors and looked at websites like StackOverflow and others. But unfortunately, I wasn't able to get it where I wanted it. 

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has really shown me that programming can be extremely difficult and it takes a lot of practice. I think this has shown me that planning out projects is extremely beneficial to the process and by using run time analysis, we can see how efficient the program will actually be. 

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has definitely shown me why comments can be crucial to understanding what is going on with a product. Without the comments to lead, it can be a confusing mess, especially if there are bugs or errors in the code. I definitely made sure to include enough that my intent is understood so it can be maintained or adapted for future projects. It also showed me the importance of making sure everything is working correctly so even the client can make changes without having to have someone develop new code.
